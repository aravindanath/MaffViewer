# MaffViewer
A quick and simple Mozilla Archive Format (MAFF) Viewer.
With the release of Firefox Quantum, the Mozilla Archive Format add-on is no longer supported. This project provides an alternative to opening those saved web pages.

## Usage
Plain easy: just drag-and-drop the maff file into the window.

## TODOs
* Handle any exceptions.
* Make it nicer.
* Add support for converting to mhtml.
* Add more built-in browser capabilities.
* Add cleanup temp files functionality.
